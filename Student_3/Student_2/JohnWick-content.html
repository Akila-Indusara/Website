             <h2>The plot of John Wick</h2>
             <img class="sub-image" src= "johnPuppy.webp" alt="johnAndPuppy">
             <div class="parah"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story revolves around the titular character, John Wick, a former assassin who is mourning the death of his beloved wife, Helen. After her death, she leaves John a puppy named Daisy as a final gift to help him cope with his grief.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, John's life takes a dark turn when he encounters a group of Russian gangsters led by Iosef Tarasov. Iosef takes an interest in John's vintage car and decides to steal it. In the process, he and his thugs break into John's home, beat him up, and kill Daisy. Unbeknownst to Iosef, John Wick is a legendary and lethal assassin with a fearsome reputation.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devastated by the loss of his wife's final gift and enraged by the senseless killing of Daisy, John Wick decides to come out of retirement to seek vengeance. He reconnects with his old friend and fellow assassin, Marcus, who offers some help. John is determined to exact retribution on those responsible, even though it means going up against his former employer, Viggo Tarasov, Iosef's father and a powerful crime lord.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As John Wick embarks on his mission of revenge, he leaves a trail of destruction in his wake. His lethal skills, expert combat techniques, and relentless pursuit make him a force to be reckoned with. Viggo, realizing the storm that John is unleashing, attempts to protect his son by sending a succession of highly skilled assassins after him.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the film, John encounters various adversaries, showcasing his deadly efficiency in combat and resourcefulness. He also discovers that there is a code among assassins, and certain locations, like the Continental Hotel, serve as neutral territories where killing is strictly prohibited.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the body count rises, John's actions attract the attention of the criminal underworld, and a bounty is placed on his head. He faces formidable challenges, but his determination and skills are unwavering.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "John Wick" is known for its high-octane action sequences, stylish visuals, and Keanu Reeves' compelling performance as the enigmatic and lethal assassin. The film's success led to several sequels that further explore the world of John Wick and his dangerous adventures in the criminal underworld.</div>

             <div class="parah"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stunt Team and Choreography: The films are renowned for their meticulously choreographed action sequences. The expert stunt team, led by Chad Stahelski (the film's director, a former stuntman himself), worked tirelessly to create visually stunning and realistic fight scenes.</div>
             <!-- <img class="sub-image" src="JWBTS3.jpg" alt="behind-the-scenes"> -->
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The franchise popularized a shooting style called "Gun Fu," which blends martial arts movements with gunplay. The choreography and execution of these sequences made them stand out and garnered a dedicated fan following.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The filmmakers emphasized practical effects over CGI whenever possible, resulting in more visceral and impactful action scenes. This approach added to the gritty and grounded feel of the films.</div>
                 
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The films' cinematography, led by Dan Laustsen, utilized vibrant colors, creative angles, and long takes to capture the intensity of the action while maintaining a sleek and stylish visual aesthetic. International Locations: The films were shot in various global locations, contributing to their international appeal and providing diverse and visually striking settings.</div>
             <!-- <img class="sub-image" src="JWBTS.jpg" alt="behind-the-scenes"> -->

             <div class="parah"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car John Wick drives in the movie is a 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, a vintage and iconic muscle car. Unfortunately, it meets a tragic fate early in the film when it is stolen by the Russian gangsters.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the gold coins used as currency in the assassin underworld were created specifically for the film and have become a recognizable symbol associated with the franchise.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The filmmakers strived to use practical effects whenever possible, minimizing the reliance on CGI to maintain a more grounded and visceral feel to the action. Inspired by Real Events: The character of John Wick and the story were partly inspired by real-life events. Director Chad Stahelski mentioned that some aspects of the film were inspired by stories of retired military and police personnel seeking justice.</div>
