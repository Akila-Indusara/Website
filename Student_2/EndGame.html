             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The movie picks up after the events of "Avengers: Infinity War," where the villainous Thanos had successfully collected all six Infinity Stones and used them to wipe out half of all life in the universe with a snap of his fingers. The remaining Avengers are left devastated and scattered across the cosmos.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story begins with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space on the Guardians of the Galaxy's ship, the Benatar. They are rescued by Captain Marvel, who brings them back to Earth to reunite with the surviving Avengers: Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Bruce Banner (Hulk), Thor, and Clint Barton (Hawkeye).</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Determined to undo Thanos' actions, the Avengers devise a plan to travel back in time and retrieve the Infinity Stones from different points in history to create their own gauntlet and reverse the snap. They split into teams to collect the stones from various significant moments in the MCU's past.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During their time-traveling adventure, they encounter past versions of themselves and face unexpected challenges. Meanwhile, Thanos, who learns about their plan, also travels to the present day and launches an assault on the Avengers' headquarters, seeking to prevent them from undoing his actions.In a climactic battle, the Avengers, along with their allies from across the MCU, fight against Thanos and his army. The battle becomes an epic showdown, and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.</div>
             <div class="parah">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tony Stark manages to steal the Infinity Stones from Thanos during the battle and, wielding them with a newly-created Iron Man gauntlet, sacrifices himself to snap Thanos and his army out of existence. The snap undoes the damage caused by Thanos in "Infinity War," but it also costs Tony his life.</div>
